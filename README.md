# 🍔 Dav’s Diner – Mobile Ordering App

Hello there! 👋
This is a fully interactive mobile-first diner ordering app built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS

👉 [Live Demo](https://davsdinner.netlify.app/)

Originally built as a Scrimba solo project, I took it further by implementing structured state management, dynamic rendering, modal-based checkout, validation handling, and polished UI interactions.

This project focuses on DOM-driven state, clean event delegation, and mobile-first layout using modern CSS.

## 🎨 Design to Code

Built from a Figma design file and implemented pixel-accurately in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Focused on translating layout, spacing, and interaction states into a responsive mobile-first UI.
